Mac OS AVPlayer using AVPlayerLayer (Swift 5/Objective-C)

As of October 9 avplayer implements:

•   Opening of files thru Drag & Drop on the PlayerView
<br>
<br>
•   Opening remote Movie files with OpenURL...
<br>
<br>
•   Examples of both Key Value Observing and Key Value Coding
<br>
<br>
•   Using Objective-C Custom UI objects from Swift code
<br>
<br>
•   Full Screen Window support
<br>
<br>
•	Support for creating Trimmed Movies

So, maybe not as simple as it started out to be.
<br>
QuickTime Player Pro 7 stops working with Mac OS Catalina so we thought we'd have some fun.
